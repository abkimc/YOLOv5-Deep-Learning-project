# Deep learning course project 
## Team Members: Alon Bar Koter, Noa Gerson, Shahar Shpitaler, Andrei Plotkin

This repository contains the group project we completed for the Deep Learning course at Ben-Gurion University during our masterâ€™s studies.
It includes the training code in a notebook, relevant configuration files, a file with a link to the training data, 
our presentation, and the final report. Our work won first place in the class competition, earning us a reward of $1,000 in AWS credits.
